## Description
DeepSig provides open synthetic wireless signal datasets used in machine learning for radio frequency (RF) research and development.

- Multiple datasets available (e.g., modulation recognition, RF fingerprinting)
- Includes labeled IQ samples
- Commonly used formats: `.h5`, `.mat`
- Range of SNRs and modulations
- Usable for supervised and unsupervised learning

## Sample Contents
This folder contains a few downloaded example files from DeepSig's modulation classification datasets for reference.

## Instructions

1. Visit [https://www.deepsig.io/datasets](https://www.deepsig.io/datasets) and create a free account to access full datasets.
2. Download the dataset you need (e.g., `RML2016.10a`, `RML2018.01a`).
3. Datasets are typically in `.h5` format and include IQ sample arrays with labels.

## Notes
- DeepSig datasets are widely cited and used in academic RFML research.
- Licensing varies by dataset, check individual pages for terms of use.
