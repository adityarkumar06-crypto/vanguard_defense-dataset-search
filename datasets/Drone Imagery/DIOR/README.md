Dataset can be obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/simplestzyp/diordataset
Consists of ~11.7k images for training and validation which is a bad configuration so it should be rearranged to 80% and 20% respectively.
Images appear to be 800x800 which is compatible for YOLO. Exceptions will have to be padded and/or scaled.
